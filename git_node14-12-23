Git ( vcs / SCM ) version control system / source code management.
 
Below are the functions of a VCS −

1. Allows developers to work simultaneously.

2. Does not allow overwriting each other’s changes.

3. Maintains a history of every version.


The Following are the types of VCS −

1. Centralized version control system (CVCS).  ===>> SVN

2. Distributed/Decentralized version control system (DVCS). ===> Git.

we will concentrate only on distributed version control system and especially on Git. Git falls under distributed version control system.

GIT ===>> alternative older VCS ==>> SVN.


Centralized version control system (CVCS) uses a central server to store all files and enables team collaboration.

 But the major drawback of CVCS is its single point of failure, i.e., failure of the central server. 

 Unfortunately, if the central server goes down for an hour, then during that hour, no one can collaborate at all.

 And even in a worst case, if the disk of the central server gets corrupted and proper backup has not been taken,

 then you will lose the entire history of the project. Here, distributed version control system (DVCS) comes into picture.
